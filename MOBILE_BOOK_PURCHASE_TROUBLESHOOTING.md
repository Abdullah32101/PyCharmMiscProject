## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Run Mobile-Specific Test
```bash
python run_mobile_book_test.py
```

### Step 2: Check Generated Files
After test run, look for:
- `mobile_book_test_failure.png` - Screenshot at failure point
- `mobile_book_test_failure.html` - Page source at failure
- `card_details_filled.png` - Screenshot after card entry
- `book_purchase_error_*.png` - Error screenshots

### Step 3: Analyze Console Logs
Look for these specific log messages:
- `[üì±] Filling billing details on Mobile`
- `[üåç] Country selected by value (Mobile)`
- `[üèôÔ∏è] State selected by text (Mobile)`
- `[üí≥] Entering card details on Mobile`
- `[‚úÖ] Card details filled successfully`

### Step 4: Check Form Field Values
Verify that all fields have correct values:
- `fname`: "Zeeshan"
- `lname`: "Ali"
- `country_name_p`: "177" (Pakistan)
- `state`: Should contain "Punjab"
- `city`: "Lahore"
- `post_code`: "54000"
- `address`: "House No 11, sector A2, Gulberg"
- `phone_number`: "032064970863333"

## Mobile-Specific Fixes Applied

- Added mobile detection and specific handling
- Multiple fallback methods for country/state selection
- Field value verification after entry
- Better error handling and logging

### 2. Improved `_fill_input()` Method
- Mobile-specific scrolling behavior
- Value verification after entry
- JavaScript fallback for failed interactions
- Better timing and delays

### 3. Enhanced `enter_card_details()` Method

To test specific devices, modify the `conftest.py` file or use the mobile test runner.

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "Element not interactable"

### "TimeoutException"
**Solution:** Increased wait times for mobile devices

### "NoSuchElementException"
**Solution:** Added JavaScript fallback for element interaction

### "StaleElementReferenceException"

## Performance Tips for Mobile Testing

1. **Use Headless Mode for CI/CD:**
   ```bash
   HEADLESS=true python run_mobile_book_test.py
   ```

2. **Reduce Wait Times for Faster Testing:**
   - Modify time.sleep() values in the code
   - Use shorter WebDriverWait timeouts

3. **Enable Screenshots Only on Failure:**
   - Screenshots are automatically saved on test failure
   - Remove screenshot calls for faster execution

## Monitoring and Logging

The enhanced code includes comprehensive logging:
- Device type detection
- Step-by-step progress
- Error details with context
- Field value verification results

## Getting Help

If issues persist:
1. Run the mobile-specific test runner
2. Check all generated screenshots and HTML files
3. Review console logs for specific error messages
4. Compare with desktop test results
5. Check if the issue is device-specific
