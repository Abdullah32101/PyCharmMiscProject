# Pages Folder Updates Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Method Files
**Problem**: The pages folder was missing two method files that corresponded to existing test files:
- `purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan_methods.py`
- `purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan_methods.py`

**Solution**: Created both missing method files with the correct class structure and methods.

### 2. Selector Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple selectors were being used for each plan button, causing conflicts and unreliable test execution.

**Solution**: Updated all method files to use specific, unique selectors for each plan button:

## Updated Selectors

### Popular Plan Button
- **Selector**: `//button[contains(@class,'new-btn-blue-area activate_button')]`
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_methods.py`
  - `purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan_methods.py`

### Monthly Plan Button
- **Selector**: `//div[@class='new-month-day-trail-1 plans-card-header']//button[@type='button'][normalize-space()='View Solution']`
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_methods.py`

### One Time Plan Button
- **Selector**: `//button[normalize-space()='Buy solution']`
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan_methods.py`

### Six Month Plan Button
- **Selector**: `//div[@class='new-month-day-trail-6 plans-card-header']//button[@type='button'][normalize-space()='View Solution']`
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_methods.py`
  - `purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan_methods.py`
  - `purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan_methods.py`

## Files Created

### 1. `pages/purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan_methods.py`
- Contains `SolutionInnPrimaryPage` class
- Includes `click_popular_plan_button()` method with correct selector
- All other necessary methods for registration, payment, etc.

### 2. `pages/purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan_methods.py`
- Contains `SolutionInnPrimaryPage` class
- Includes `click_six_month_plan_button()` method with correct selector
- All other necessary methods for registration, payment, etc.

## Files Updated

### 1. `pages/purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_methods.py`
- Updated `click_monthly_access_button()` to use specific selector
- Updated `click_popular_plan_button()` to use specific selector
- Updated `click_six_month_plan_button()` to use specific selector
- Removed multiple selector fallback logic for cleaner, more reliable code

### 2. `pages/purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan_methods.py`
- Updated `click_one_time_plan_button()` to use specific selector
- Updated `click_six_month_plan_button()` to use specific selector
- Removed multiple selector fallback logic for cleaner, more reliable code

### 3. `tests/test_purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan.py`
- Updated import to use the correct method file:
  - `from pages.purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan_methods import SolutionInnPrimaryPage`

### 4. `tests/test_purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan.py`
- Updated import to use the correct method file:
  - `from pages.purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan_methods import SolutionInnPrimaryPage`

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Eliminated Selector Conflicts**: Each plan button now has a unique, specific selector
2. **Improved Test Reliability**: No more multiple selector attempts that could cause confusion
3. **Better Organization**: Each test file now imports from its corresponding method file
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed complex fallback logic in favor of specific, reliable selectors
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Clear mapping between test files and method files

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run each test individually** to verify the selectors work correctly
2. **Test on both mobile and desktop** to ensure responsive behavior
3. **Monitor for any remaining selector issues** and adjust if needed
4. **Verify that each plan button is correctly identified** by its unique selector

## Next Steps

1. Test all the updated files to ensure they work correctly
2. If any issues arise, the specific selectors can be easily adjusted
3. Consider adding logging to track which selector is being used for debugging
4. Monitor test execution times to ensure the simplified selectors improve performance
