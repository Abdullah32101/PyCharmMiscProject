# File Rename Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive file renaming operation that was performed to make the test suite more descriptive and organized.

## File Rename Mapping

## Class Name Changes

### Page Object Classes
| Old Class Name | New Class Name | File |
|----------------|----------------|------|
| `BookPage` | `OneTimeBookPurchasePage` | `one_time_book_purchase_methods.py` |
| `SolutionInnPrimaryPage` | `SolutionInnPrimaryPage` | `purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_methods.py` |
| `SolutionInnSecondaryPage` | `SolutionInnSecondaryPage` | `purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan_methods.py` |

### Test Function Names
| Old Function Name | New Function Name | File |
|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| `test_monthly_plan_flow` | `test_purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_flow` | `test_purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan.py` |
| `test_one_time_plan` | `test_purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan` | `test_purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan.py` |
| `test_click_popular_plan_button` | `test_purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan` | `test_purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan.py` |
| `test_click_six_month_plan_button` | `test_purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan` | `test_purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan.py` |

## Import Statement Updates

All test files have been updated to use the new import paths:

```python
# Old imports
from pages.expertquestions_stage1_methods import SolutionInnPrimaryPage
from pages.expertquestions_stage2_methods import SolutionInnSecondaryPage
from pages.bookpurchase_methods import BookPage

# New imports
from pages.purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_methods import SolutionInnPrimaryPage
from pages.purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan_methods import SolutionInnSecondaryPage
from pages.one_time_book_purchase_methods import OneTimeBookPurchasePage
```

## Database Updates

The database has been updated to reflect the new module names:

- `test_book_purchase` → `test_one_time_book_purchase`
- `test_monthly_plan` → `test_purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan`
- `test_onetime_plan` → `test_purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan`
- `test_plan_popular` → `test_purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan`
- `test_six_month_plan` → `test_purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan`

## Benefits of the Rename

1. **Clarity**: File names now clearly describe what each test does
2. **Organization**: Better separation between book purchase and membership plan tests
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and maintain the test suite
4. **Consistency**: All files follow a consistent naming convention
5. **Documentation**: File names serve as self-documenting code

## Usage Examples

### Running Individual Tests
```bash
# Monthly plan test
python run_purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_test.py

# One-time plan test
python run_purchase_membership_question_by_one_time_plan_test.py

# Popular plan test
python run_purchase_membership_question_by_three_month_popular_plan_test.py

# Six-month plan test
python run_purchase_membership_questions_by_six_month_plan_test.py

# One-time book purchase test
python run_one_time_book_purchase_with_reports.py
```

### Running All Tests
```bash
# All membership plan tests
python run_all_membership_plan_tests.py

# Mobile-specific tests
python run_all_membership_plan_tests.py mobile
```

### Using pytest directly
```bash
# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan.py

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/test_purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan.py::test_purchase_membership_question_by_monthly_plan_flow
```

## Cleanup Script

A cleanup script (`cleanup_old_files.py`) has been created to:
1. Remove old files after verification
2. Update database module names
3. Verify all new files exist

Run the cleanup script after verifying all new files are working correctly:
```bash
python cleanup_old_files.py
```

## Verification

To verify the rename was successful:

1. Check that all new files exist
2. Run a few tests to ensure they work
3. Check the database for updated module names
4. Verify that old files have been removed

## Notes

- All functionality remains the same
- Only file names, class names, and import paths have changed
- Test logic and behavior are unchanged
- Database integration continues to work as before
- Error link feature remains fully functional
