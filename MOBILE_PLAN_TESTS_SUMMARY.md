# Mobile Plan Tests - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Mobile Version Not Running for Monthly and Onetime Plans**
**Problem**: Monthly and onetime plan tests were not properly handling mobile devices.

**Root Causes**:
- No mobile-specific scrolling behavior
- Missing mobile detection and handling
- Inadequate field filling for mobile devices
- No JavaScript fallbacks for mobile interactions

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Enhanced Page Methods (`pages/expertquestions_stage1_methods.py` and `pages/expertquestions_stage2_methods.py`)
- ✅ Added mobile detection: `is_mobile = self.driver.execute_script("return window.innerWidth < 768;")`
- ✅ Enhanced scrolling with smooth behavior for mobile: `scrollIntoView({block: 'center', behavior: 'smooth'})`
- ✅ Mobile-specific field filling with verification
- ✅ JavaScript fallbacks for all interactions
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging

#### Key Improvements:
```python
# Mobile-specific scrolling
if is_mobile:
    self.driver.execute_script("arguments[0].scrollIntoView({block: 'center', behavior: 'smooth'});", button)
    time.sleep(1)  # Wait for scroll to complete
else:
    self.driver.execute_script("arguments[0].scrollIntoView({block: 'center'});", button)
    time.sleep(0.5)

# Mobile-specific field filling
def _fill_card_field_mobile(self, wait, element_id, value, delay_per_key=False):
    """Enhanced field filling for mobile devices"""
    # Scroll to field with smooth behavior
    # Clear and fill field
    # Verify the value was entered correctly
    # JavaScript fallback if needed
```

### 2. **Database Device Name and Resolution Issues**
**Problem**: Device names and screen resolutions were not being properly captured and stored in the database.

**Root Causes**:
- Device name not being passed correctly from conftest.py
- Screen resolution detection failing
- No fallback mechanisms for device detection

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Enhanced Conftest.py (`conftest.py`)
- ✅ Global device information storage
- ✅ Real-time screen resolution detection from driver
- ✅ Fallback device detection using user agent and viewport
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging for device information

#### Key Improvements:
```python
# Global variable to store device information
_device_info = {"name": "unknown", "resolution": "unknown"}

# Store device information in driver fixture
global _device_info
_device_info["name"] = device

# Update resolution with actual values from driver
try:
    width = driver.execute_script("return window.innerWidth;")
    height = driver.execute_script("return window.innerHeight;")
    _device_info["resolution"] = f"{width}x{height}"
    print(f"[📱] Updated device info - Name: {_device_info['name']}, Resolution: {_device_info['resolution']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[⚠️] Could not get actual resolution: {e}")
```
